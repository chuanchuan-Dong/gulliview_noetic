# Project Overview  

This project is an early-stage system aiming to integrate ROS with the GulliView system.  
The goal is to create a more structured and efficient solution that can potentially be used in **Chalmers Lab 5355**.  

Currently, an original GulliView system is running, and this project seeks to improve upon it.  
Note: This system is still under development and has not been extensively tested.  

This project is based on [apritag_ros](https://github.com/AprilRobotics/apriltag_ros), which provide powerful API to make apritag detection.


### Setup

Manually store testbed image attached with floortag when make a change. e.g. /gulliview_noetic/apritag_ros/config/data/camx.jpg

Also change the path on global_client launch file.
